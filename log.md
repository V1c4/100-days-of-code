# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 9, 2019
##### Coding review

**Today's Progress**: Learn how to make loops, calls, $_GET and $_POST in PHP

**Thoughts:** I didn't feel today overwhelmed by the flood of new informations in PHP. Concerning my main project, I'm still struggling with reading stuffs about three.js. I've just registered to the JS programm on FreeCodeCamp. During my training classes, I can understand what the instructor say. For the second one in Golang, I'm going to watch a video from Inanc Gumus's course on Udemy.

### Day 2: October 10, 2019
##### Coding review

**Today's Progress**: Succeeded to use my Git Bash to upload a file from Github, create my first programm using PHP, did some JS exercises

**Thoughts:** I felt overjoyed to manage to use Git Bash to open a clone file from Github. I spent two hours reading and forking projects in Go for beginners. I also did a great job with two of my pals by making a basic website within one hour using PHP. I also managed to have a long chat with my coworker about my end-of-study project. Great IT day !

### Day 3: October 11, 2019
##### Coding review

**Today's Progress**: Watched my first video about WebGL, tried to understand statements and expressions in Go and managed to create a forum and a login space with PHP

**Thoughts:** Today, I was a bit tired due to lack of sleep, I guess. The beginning of the day started with videos from Inanc Gumus about how to build packages in the metro and a video about how to make a triangle on WebGL. Then, in training class, I began with queries from DB on PHP. The logic was not so complicated but I need to exercise more to be more focused on syntax. I often messed up quote with double quotes in concatenations. Anyway, at the end of the day, I was watching Inanc's videos about statements and expressions in Go in metro.
