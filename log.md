**Today's Progress**: Learn how to make loops, calls, $_GET and $_POST in PHP

**Thoughts:** I didn't feel today overwhelmed by the flood of new informations in PHP. Concerning my main project, I'm still struggling with reading stuffs about three.js. I've just registered to the JS programm on FreeCodeCamp. During my training classes, I can understand what the instructor say. For the second one in Golang, I'm going to watch a video from Inanc Gumus's course on Udemy.
