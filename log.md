# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 9, 2019
##### Coding review

**Today's Progress**: Learn how to make loops, calls, $_GET and $_POST in PHP

**Thoughts:** I didn't feel today overwhelmed by the flood of new informations in PHP. Concerning my main project, I'm still struggling with reading stuffs about three.js. I've just registered to the JS programm on FreeCodeCamp. During my training classes, I can understand what the instructor say. For the second one in Golang, I'm going to watch a video from Inanc Gumus's course on Udemy.

### Day 2: October 10, 2019
##### Coding review

**Today's Progress**: Succeeded to use my Git Bash to upload a file from Github, create my first programm using PHP, did some JS exercises

**Thoughts:** I felt overjoyed to manage to use Git Bash to open a clone file from Github. I spent two hours reading and forking projects in Go for beginners. I also did a great job with two of my pals by making a basic website within one hour using PHP. I also managed to have a long chat with my coworker about my end-of-study project. Great IT day !
